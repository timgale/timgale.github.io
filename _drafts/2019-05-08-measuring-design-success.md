How do we know if our design decisions are successful?

Design has an impact across the entire experience of a product, but how can we measure its effectiveness with so many factors at play?

Let's take a look at a few ways to use the tools at our disposal to give us indications of success when it comes to product design. From field studies to engagement metrics, we’ll explore how each method of measurement can be suited to particular scenarios, with examples of how they’ve been applied to produce positive effects.

But first, a couple of definitions.

Quantify the value of design to the wider organisation.


### What is success?

The Oxford Engligh Dictionary defines success as:

> The accomplishment of an aim or a purpose.

Pretty clear, right?

What if we look at it from a product perspective:

> The accomplishment of an aim or a purpose that achieves an outcome.

Achieving some kind of outcome, a change in behaviour or simply putting a smile on someones face should be the end goal of a successful experience.


### What is good design?

> Two of the most important characteristics of good design are discoverability and understanding. **– Donald Norman**

Making sure people can find what they are looking for and instantly know how to use it, comes as a result of knowing their goals and making thoughtful decisions.

Having the tools to measure the effects these decisions have on a product experience allows both designers _and_ customers to be confident in achieving success.


### Key Experience Indicators

The following are a series of indicators that aim to focus on the specifics of a person's interaction with a product or website, producing actionable results whilst giving benchmarks to improve from.
