## Summary
{: class="narrow"}

UK Retreats one of the leading providers of mini breaks and getaway destinations across the UK, with a large following on social media.
{: class="narrow"}

## Goal
{: class="narrow"}

With the launch of the new product experience, UK Retreats needed to update their marketing website and sign up process to match. We wanted to clearly demonstrate the value provided to customers using the landing page.

## Discovery
{: class="narrow"}

### Stakeholder Interviews
{: class="narrow"}

Through a series of discussions with the team behind UK Retreats, I was able to identify the best path forward that would show the core product functionality in action as prospects browsed the landing page.
{: class="narrow"}

### Market Research
{: class="narrow"}

UK Retreatsâ€™ unique position meant that much of their business came through Instagram, due to the high quality video production used to promote each of their listings. This meant they had a strong USP that competitors may not have invested into.

## Outcome
{: class="narrow"}

I wanted to tell a story as the user navigated through the page, emulating the core user journey from the perspective of someone looking for a place to stay, and ultimately booking their getaway.

This involved using subtle yet detailed animations as the user scrolls, or prompting people to stop momentarily to not only read about, but experience the features that provide the most value.

## Reflection
{: class="narrow"}

Given the engaging feature set on offer with the UK Retreats platform, the was the perfect opportunity for me to both showcase exactly how these works through engaging content right on the landing page. As the client was keen to push the boundaries, I had the flexibility to try out new interactions using Framer, and deliver the end result with confidence.
{: class="narrow"}

A really enjoyable project, and a well received user experience to manage and deliver.
