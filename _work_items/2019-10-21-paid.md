## Summary
{: class="narrow"}

Paid is a procurement challenger platform that makes it simple for buyers to onboard their suppliers, automate contracts and streamline the payment process for all involved.
{: class="narrow"}

## Goal
{: class="narrow"}

Improve the working relationship between buyers and suppliers. Making the procurement process an equal opportunity for all involved, regardless of size.
{: class="narrow"}

## Discovery
{: class="narrow"}

### Market Analysis
{: class="narrow"}

We could segment our competitors based on the depth of service they offered and how closely related they were to the problem space we were operating within.
{: class="narrow"}

### User Research
{: class="narrow"}

#### User interviews
{: class="narrow"}

We took the 20 most active suppliers on the platform and reached out to them with the offer of participating in our research study. We were able to speak with the majority of the suppliers to understand their perspective on the things that were getting in the way of working efficiently with their clients.
{: class="narrow"}

To ensure we were supporting the needs of our customers on the buyer side as well as the suppliers, I gathered insights from our internal customer success team to identify the key themes that were preventing them from getting the most out of the platform.
{: class="narrow"}

#### Research insights
{: class="narrow"}

- Suppliers found the onboarding process to be too long and didnâ€™t know why they were being asked certain questions about their business.
- Suppliers who had a brick and mortar premises would often prefer to have the option to take payments via card online.
- The most common issue buyers faced in the process of working with suppliers was not having visibility of where they were in the process of onboarding and completing the work.
{: class="narrow"}

I lead the supplier research, arranged the monetary incentives ahead of time, and spoke with the business owners directly via phone and video calls.
{: class="narrow"}

Following the study we were able to build up a pool of reference clients on the supplier side that made further rounds of research much smoother, getting the insights into the team and iterating much faster than before.
{: class="narrow"}

#### Synthesising the insights
{: class="narrow"}

Taking the key themes forward, I ran workshops with internal stakeholders to share the details to ensure alignment between user needs and  business goals.
{: class="narrow"}

![Paid Project Setup Payment Sample](/images/paid-case-study-mapping.png)

#### The output of these workshops included
{: class="narrow"}

- A decision to move forward with additional payment options based on user preference.
- Revisit the supplier onboarding flow from the ground up to see where we could remove unnecessary steps and make it clear why we needed to capture the information we were asking for.
{: class="narrow"}

User personas were enhanced to act as reference points for the team to ensure a shared understanding when building out our solutions.

## Overcoming issues
{: class="narrow"}

Some suppliers had large, long term projects, so they only needed to access the platform once every few months. 
{: class="narrow"}

To address this use case, we wanted to ensure that people could easily pick up where they left off when returning to the platform.
{: class="narrow"}

Working with engineering to ensure suppliers could get a high level of security without needing to log in in order to confirm a project or transaction.
{: class="narrow"}

We tested unique links based on the ID of the person receiving the email notifications, that granted access to a limited area of the product that would allow them to complete their tasks with as little friction as possible.
{: class="narrow"}

![Paid Project Setup Payment Sample](/images/paid-case-study-email-templates.png)

![Paid Project Setup Payment Sample](/images/paid-case-study-buyer-dashboard.png)

It was crucial to get the experience right here, since we still wanted to give a feeling of trust when signing documents and confirming payment details.
{: class="narrow"}

![Paid Project Setup Payment Sample](/images/paid-case-study-mobile-payment.png)

## Outcome
{: class="narrow"}

We delivered the solutions and tested with our reference customers defined during our initial research.
{: class="narrow"}

Improved supplier satisfaction, improved buyer process and carbon footprint awareness.
{: class="narrow"}


We saw that the improvements we made to the onboarding flows brought more clarity and reduced the time taken to get setup. We also noticed a reduction in support queries around this process.
{: class="narrow"}


By allowing people to chose their preferred payment method during setup, we found a significant reduction in the average time taken to complete the once a job had been finished, meaning the supplier could be paid sooner than they previously had been.

![Paid Project Setup Payment Sample](/images/paid-case-study-supplier-onboarding-2.png)

![Paid Project Setup Payment Sample](/images/paid-case-study-supplier-onboarding-3.png)

We kept in close contact with our biggest clients on the buyer side while rolling out more visibility on supplier activity. We saw a noticeable increase in user satisfaction with a reduction in time spent chasing suppliers over email, alongside a drastic reduction in supplier onboarding times due to the lightweight version we had shipped in the weeks following.

## Design Operations
{: class="narrow"}

As the product grew and matured, it was clear that we needed to invest the time into creating and maintaining a scalable design system.
{: class="narrow"}

I took the lead on putting the foundations in place, porting over existing, validated designs to the system to start with a solid base, while working closely with our engineering team to put in place a naming system we could implement across the full stack.
{: class="narrow"}

![Paid Project Setup Payment Sample](/images/paid-case-study-design-system-flow.png)

The investments we made into the internal designer and developer experience gave our workflow a boost. With Figma and Storybook always in sync, we could test out new features knowing the components and patterns used were established, consistent and most importantly, fit for purpose.
{: class="narrow"}

## Reflection
{: class="narrow"}

Always keeping in mind the needs and wants of two separate sets of users was a huge challenge. Bringing with it a great opportunity to step back and see things holistically, helping me to arrive at solutions that would benefit both parties, while playing into the strengths and mental models of each.
{: class="narrow"}

Working with the team at Paid gave me a fresh perspective on how we the expectations in B2B and B2B*2C* software are now very much aligned with the consumer space when it comes to the user experience. 
{: class="narrow"}

As we tested familiar language, and interaction patterns that would traditionally only be found in the B2C space, we found that many of the suppliers we served would prefer this approach to be carried over to their business tools. 
{: class="narrow"}

Fundamentally, we validated that concepts such as gamification and delightful interactions can feel at home in B2B software, provided the feeling of security and reassurance remains when dealing with finances.

### User Research

#### User interviews

We took the 20 most active suppliers on the platform and reached out to them with the offer of participating in our research study. We were able to speak with the majority of the suppliers to understand their perspective on the things that were getting in the way of working efficiently with their clients.

Research insights:

- Suppliers found that using multiple services for handling work, invoices and payments meant that they were paying significant costs both in time and money to complete a job.
- It was common for suppliers to create reoccurring jobs many times across different clients and did not have a way to manage this effectively.
- Suppliers who had a brick and mortar premises would often prefer to have the option to take payments via card online.

I lead the research, arranged the monetary incentives ahead of time, and spoke with the business owners directly via phone and video calls.

## Outcome

## Reflection / What I would do differently

Paid provides small businesses and freelancers with fast invoice financing, freeing them of the burden of having to chase clients for outstanding payments.

<!-- ![Paid Project Setup Payment Sample](/images/work-item-paid.png) -->

<!-- ## Overview

The Paid team were looking to optimise the core user journeys within their web app, as well as being in need of an update to their visual design direction as they were gaining traction in the market.

I worked closely with the founder and engineering team to understand their goals and current capabilities, and redesigned the project setup flow and the main dashboard. I also established a system of reusable components to help them roll out the design refresh across the entire app.

## Design System

![Paid Project Setup Payment Sample](/images/paid-image-3.png)

To ensure consistency in the product experience, as well as to provide the team with a library of components for reference going forward, the Paid design system was delivered. <a href="https://figma.com" target="_blank">Figma</a> was used to house all design assets and screen layouts for this project, mainly due to the advanced support for component management and the ability to easily share progress and collaborate.

## Project Setup

Initial customer feedback indicated the process of setting up a new project was cumbersome. My objective was to break down the process into easy to digest steps whilst ensuring all relevant information was captured to build up the contract details.

![Paid Project Setup Payment Sample](/images/project-paid_setup_payment.png)

## Dashboard

Both the suppliers and clients accessing the platform required a centralised hub to get an understanding of their project progress at a glance. One use case that needed addressing however was the onboarding process.

![Paid Dashboard Sample](/images/project-paid_dashboard-progress-75.png)

I proposed the approach of using a chart visualisation to indicate what the user needed to do next, as well as the steps already completed to give people a sense of accomplishment, nudging them along the process. Clear visualisations coupled with motivational copy and positive iconography proved to be the direction needed to encourage users to complete the steps required and start getting the most out of the platform.

To tap into that sense of accomplishment, we opted to start people off on 25% completion after their first time logging in, adding to that sense of achievement with minimal effort from the user. -->
