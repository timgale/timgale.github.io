## Summary
{: class="narrow"}

Sky TV customers are often looking to make changes to their packages, and as a result can spend a long time speaking with advisors over the phone, which can lead to long wait times and creates unnecessary frustration. Traditionally this would be the only way for customers to manage their services, The introduction of My Sky and online self service aimed to reduce call times and help make the customer experience a rewarding one for all involved.
{: class="narrow"}

## Goal
{: class="narrow"}

The goal for this project was all around call deflection. A reduction in customer queries coming into the call centres would provide an indication that people were getting the answers they needed elsewhere. 
{: class="narrow"}

Our hypotheisis was that by introducing and promoting the online capabilities, people would be more likely to use the digital self service tools available to manage their Sky package.

## Discovery

### New Customer Journey
{: class="narrow"}

To better understand the needs and goals of our key users, I conducted a number of research activities including:
{: class="narrow"}

- Customer call centre call listening
- User bevahiour data analysis
- NPS survey comments
{: class="narrow"}

To solidify the insights gained and share this with the team, I translated the findings into a number of artificats, with the new customer journey map being a key output that helped us move forward with acurate data.

To make this user journey easy to understand for as many people across the company as possible, I established the 4 phases that a new Sky customer would typically go through.

## Common Pain Points
{: class="narrow"}

Through the research, we identified that one of the most common reasons people call up is to get updates on their orders. This includes new TV and broadband services that are yet to go live, as well as physical home equipment.
{: class="narrow"}

Closely related to this, we saw an increasing trend of people needing to reschedule their engineer visit to install this equipment.

### Engineer Rescheduling Journey
{: class="narrow"}

At the time, there was no way for people to change the delivery and installation dates online.
{: class="narrow"}

This was a great opportunity for us to inroduce new digital, self servce capabilities while having a potentially significant impact on the satisfaction of our customers.
