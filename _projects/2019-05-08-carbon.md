By providing clients with high quality intent, behavioural and demographic data, the Carbon Data Management Platform enables rich personalisation and targeting ensuring people are given appropriately tailored content with every visit to their favourite blog, online store or national news outlet.


### Use Cases

#### For Publishers

Enabling Publishers to make audiences built up of high value users, enabling their on-site advertisers to better personalise the content provided to visitors.

#### For Advertisers

Advertisers need to create bespoke customer segments that are in-market for particular products and services. Activating these segments with their ad management software or extending to find like minded people who share similar intent, is crucial.

### Insights

Our customers need to quickly understand the intent and demographic make up of their users. The goal of Carbon Insights is to provide high level, actionable data at a glance, with the ability to dig deeper into more granular data points where necessary.

Current purchasing trends and brand affinity are promoted throughout the insights, as these have proven to be major drivers in the campaigns ran by our customers.

### Audience Hub

The Audience Hub is a centralised space for all custom, suggested and hand curated audience segments, that can be activated and exported to various demand side platforms to power ad campaigns.

### Audience Creation and Activation

Although Carbon suggests the most appropriate segments based on the preferences of customers, more complex custom audiences can be built and activated using familiar interface patterns when required.
