### background

### Challenge

The task was to provide users with an intuitive interface to browse, filter and book hotels from any device, whilst ensuring a consistent feeling of trust is reflected throughout each journey.

### Property Details

Providing users with enough information to make an informed decision was imperative. The majority of this information would be surfaced as part of the property details view, as well as hosting room availability and booking options.

Iterating quite heavily around the room selection process, we refined this initial step in the booking process to increase clarity to allow users to quickly scan their options. By taking inspiration from
proven practices in this space and gathering qualitative research, we we're able to build a solution that resonated well with our audience.

### Flight Selection

The introduction of flight booking allowed us provide users with a holiday package offering. The level of information surfaced through the interface significantly increased with this addition, so to counteract this we altered the flow of content for a digestible reading experience, whilst highlighting the key pieces of information that provide the most value to the user.
