### Background

Papertrail are a rapidly growing startup who deliver an asset management platform for organisations and suppliers within the health and safety industry.

I worked closely with the team to enhance the experience of both their flagship web application and marketing website.

### Challenge

Each record held within the system contains a trail of updates that have been applied to it. These updates can include inspection logs, notes, images & tags, as well as many other user initiated changes. The challenge involved grouping these updates in such a way that the timeline could provide users with both an overview at a glance and more information when required.

### Customer Engagement

Given the diverse client list, communicating the benefits of the application involved providing a tailored feature list for each industry. Surfacing inventory samples that resonate with the prospecting client would give a realistic expectation of how the product would help ease their process.
