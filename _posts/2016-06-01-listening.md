I've read a lot of great books this year. I've also listened to a lot of great content through various podcasts. Whilst naturally flocking to the design related material to begin with, I quickly discovered there's so much more content to unlock, with far less risk involved compared to committing to a new hardback.

Here's a short roundup of the stand out podcasts I’ve been listening to over the past few months:


### Design Details

Each episode is a deep dive into the Silicon Valley tech scene with some of the industry’s veterans. Particularly insightful for those of us across the pond.

### Reply All

This podcast will surprise you with little nuggets of trivia from around the web, outside of your daily bubble. Often obscure but always engaging.

### The Message

Not my typical choice of podcast but well worth it for the suspense each episode builds. The production quality alone makes this a great listen, sci-fi fan or not.

### Developer Tea

Don’t judge a podcast by it’s cover, this one is as much (if not more so) about professional development than it is about building software. Short episodes and a host of great guests.

### Serial

Another series offering unrivalled production value with the kind of narrative and acting you would expect from an award winning drama.

### The Tim Ferriss Show

Being a long time follower of his exploits, this is a clear contender. Having tried the 4-Hour Body, I can say that Tim knows how to optimise most aspects of life. Plenty of practical content and noteworthy interviews to be found here.

### The Moth

Gripping real life stories to give some you perspective. Reading the experiences of others is one thing, but hearing them first hand carries some real impact.
